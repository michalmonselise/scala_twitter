Tech Talk Proposal


My tech talk will be on Spark DataFrames.

DataFrames are the basic building block for data science. I will be discussing how they work in the backend as well as how to use them.

I will be covering different inputs (json, parquet, avro), aggregate functions, persisting tables, and inferring schemas.
